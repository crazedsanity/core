# Core Libraries for All Things Crazed(Sanity).

These are the core PHP libraries for all things Crazed(Sanity).  Pretty much every other (new) library from CrazedSanity depends on these libaries.

This was created as a separate repository for the purposes of... keeping things sane... maybe.  Everything is checked-out using Composer/Packagist, so I've re-arranged things a bit to compensate.  Hopefully this brings more sanity without creating a version hell of my own design.

NOTE TO SELF: fix this README. ;)
